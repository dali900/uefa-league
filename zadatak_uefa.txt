Game 1: You are playing against stronger opponent, so you need to concentrate on defence. You should choose 5 best defenders, 4 best midfielders and the fastest striker for counter attacks.

Game 2: Second opponent seams equal to yours team quality. Build a regular, 4-4-2 formation of best players.

Game 3: The weakest opponent and we need 3 points to qualify into the finals. Lets attack! Attacking formation is 3-4-3. Focus on players quality as counter attacks are not important in this game.
